#  Optimizing Hospital Operations Through Data Insights

A data analytics project developed during industrial training at **Pisoft Informatics Pvt. Ltd.**, aimed at enhancing hospital decision-making and operational efficiency using **Python**, **Power BI**, and **structured hospital datasets** (OPD, IPD, LAB, Inventory, and Staff Scheduling).

---

##  Project Overview

This project transforms raw hospital data into actionable business intelligence using **Power BI dashboards**, statistical analysis, and data cleaning techniques. By analyzing patient flow, service usage, staff workload, inventory consumption, and revenue patterns, it enables data-driven decisions that improve hospital performance and patient care.

##  Tools & Technologies

* **Power BI** – Dashboards, KPIs, DAX, and interactivity
* **Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)** – EDA, data cleaning, trend analysis
* **DAX** – Measures and calculated columns
* **Excel** – Data input, preprocessing

##  Types of Analytics Applied

###  1. **Descriptive Analytics** – *What is happening?*

* **Tools**: Power BI, Python (Pandas, Seaborn), DAX
* **Insights**:

  * Total patients admitted, visited OPD, or took lab tests
  * Department-wise revenue generation
  * Monthly trends of patient inflow and revenue
  * Top doctors and services by frequency

###  2. **Diagnostic Analytics** – *Why is it happening?*

* **Tools**: Power BI interactive dashboards, filters, and DAX logic
* **Examples**:

  * Busiest and slowest days identified using weekday-based patient visit trends
  * Age and gender analysis shows adults are the primary service users
  * Inventory cost spikes linked to specific high-cost suppliers

###  3. **Prescriptive Analytics** – *What should be done?*

* **Tools**: DAX logic + visual-driven recommendations
* **Key Recommendations**:

  * Add more doctors on Mondays to reduce OPD overload
  * Target adult demographics with wellness marketing
  * Replace high-cost suppliers with cost-efficient ones
  * Promote underutilized high-potential departments (e.g., Cardiology)

##  Dashboards & KPIs

| **Dashboard**                | **Key KPIs & Visuals**                                     |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Hospital Performance Summary | Patient count, revenue, age group analysis, monthly trends |
| Doctor Insights              | Top doctors, patient per doctor, workload analysis         |
| Time-Flow Analysis           | Busiest/least busy days, heatmaps for hours/days           |
| Inventory Management         | Supplier performance, cost tracking, quantity trends       |
| Service Utilization          | Most/least used services, revenue by service               |

---

##  Project Outcomes

* Built a **scalable and dynamic Power BI dashboard** for hospital administrators.
* Identified **hidden inefficiencies** in patient flow and staff allocation.
* Recommended **cost-saving and revenue-boosting** strategies.
* Demonstrated **hands-on application** of industry tools in a real-world healthcare setting.

---

##  How to Run

1. Load Excel/CSV datasets into Power BI or Python.
2. Use Power Query Editor to clean and preprocess data.
3. Build DAX measures (e.g., Total Revenue, Busiest Day).
4. Design visual dashboards (filterable by department, time).
5. Publish and share dashboards via Power BI Service.
